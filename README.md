# üë®üèª‚Äçüíª My Portfolio

## üìÉ Description

This is part of the [Oracle Next Education](https://www.oracle.com/br/education/oracle-next-education/) project, which gives opportunities for those who can't afford a good programming course, but want to build a career. It's the result after two weeks of coding. I made this site based on Alura's Figma Design, but I added my own twists into it.

After months studying, jumping from language to language and finally sticking with front-end programming, I decided to come back and finish it, and refactor a lot of the code. I still have a lot to learn, but I've enjoyed making it so much!
